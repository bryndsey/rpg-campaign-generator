# RPG Gampaign Generator

For now, this is an experiment for me to play around with generative AI.

The idea is that I am interested in running an RPG campaign, but I want to accelerate the process of coming up with ideas, plot details, settings, etc.

This tool currently allows you to enter a word/phrase/series of words to suggest a tone, topic, or genre, and an overview of the campaign will be created.

It is still in a very rough state, but I think serves as a decent proof of concept.
